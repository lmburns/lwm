## Linux Window Manager

### Status
- **WIP**

- This repo may possibly be wiped once a stable release is developed

A window manager built for X11.

### Idea / Goal

This window manager is a combination of [`bspwm`](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) and [`wzrd`](https://github.com/deurzen/wzrd).

The idea came from wanting to learn more about how `X11` window managers work. I use
`bspwm` as a window manager and love Rust, so I wanted to try and copy `bpswm` into a Rust
format. I'm also not fully aware of all of the features that various window managers have,
and may possibly add some additional features to what `bspwm` already has--namely a scratchpad.
